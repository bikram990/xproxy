1. +a =FilterContext= class is needed, to pass contents that filters needed+

2. in =HttpRequestDecoder= and =HttpResponseDecoder=, use =std::unique_ptr= instead naked =new= operation

3. make methods =start()=, =stop()= in =Connection= virtual, the implementation of =ServerConnection= and =ClientConnection= should be different

4. some initialization work need to be done when constructing a connection class, try to do in =XXXConnection::create()= method

5. the container =std::vector= in =HttpContainer= is not suitable for modification, change a suitable one

6. update proxy filter logic to correctly handle the following situation:

   1) a request comes, it needs proxy, then a proxy established
   2) its response is a redirection
   3) the second request comes from the same socket, but it does not need a proxy
   4) then it will be sent to proxy server socket

   the opposite situation is also need to considered
