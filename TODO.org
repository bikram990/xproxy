1. +a =FilterContext= class is needed, to pass contents that filters needed+

2. +in =HttpRequestDecoder= and =HttpResponseDecoder=, use =std::unique_ptr= instead naked =new= operation+

3. +make methods =start()=, =stop()= in =Connection= virtual, the implementation of =ServerConnection= and =ClientConnection= should be different+

4. +some initialization work need to be done when constructing a connection class, try to do in =XXXConnection::create()= method+

5. +the container =std::vector= in =HttpContainer= is not suitable for modification, change a suitable one+

6. the =shared_ptr=/=weak_ptr= relationship in =Connection=/=HttpMessage= is not needed, refine them later

7. we may use normal type instead of pointer of the =ByteBuffer= member in =SegmentalByteBuffer=

8. +remove =#include<boost/asio.hpp>= in "common.h", just define simple things there+

9. consider to remove certs in =CertManager= after some time

10. remove unnecessary "virtual" function definitions, especially in class =Connection=

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. consider to design a more better buffering system

2. use Google Mock to do unit test
